## ‚úÖ Phase 1 Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2, ensure:

- [ ] All stakeholder interviews completed
- [ ] Business requirements fully documented
- [ ] Use cases clearly defined
- [ ] Architecture design approved
- [ ] Success metrics established
- [ ] Budget and timeline confirmed
- [ ] Team roles assigned
- [ ] Bird.com access secured
- [ ] WhatsApp Business Account ready
- [ ] OpenAI API key obtained

## üöß Common Pitfalls

1. **Rushing the planning phase** - Take time to understand the business deeply
2. **Vague success metrics** - Define specific, measurable KPIs
3. **Ignoring constraints** - Document all Bird.com platform limitations
4. **Incomplete use cases** - Cover edge cases and error scenarios
5. **Missing stakeholder buy-in** - Ensure all key people are aligned

## üîó Next Steps

Once Phase 1 is complete and approved:
1. Create client folder in `phase-2-configuration/`
2. Begin with profile setup configuration
3. Follow the step-by-step guides in Phase 2
