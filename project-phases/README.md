# 📋 Project Phases - BMAD Implementation Guide

This directory contains the structured 3-phase approach for implementing AI Employees on Bird.com using the BMAD methodology.

## 🎯 Overview

The BMAD-Bird implementation is divided into three distinct phases, each with specific deliverables and validation points:

```
Phase 1: Planning (1-2 weeks)
Phase 2: Configuration (2-3 weeks)  
Phase 3: Testing (1-2 weeks)
```

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start a new implementation**:
   - Create a new client folder in each phase directory
   - Use client name in lowercase (e.g., `koaj`, `urbanhub`)
   - Follow the naming conventions specified in CLAUDE.md

2. **Follow the phase sequence**:
   - Complete Phase 1 before moving to Phase 2
   - Each phase has quality gates that must be passed
   - Document everything as you progress

3. **Use the BMAD agents**:
   - Phase 1: Analyst → PM → Architect
   - Phase 2: Scrum Master → Configuration Agent
   - Phase 3: QA Agent → Configuration Agent (optimization)

## 📊 Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning
**Goal**: Create comprehensive plan for AI Employee implementation

**Key Activities**:
- Business requirements analysis
- Product requirements definition
- Technical architecture design
- Success metrics establishment

**Deliverables**:
- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Architecture Document
- Success Metrics Framework

### Phase 2: Configuration Implementation
**Goal**: Execute manual configuration in Bird.com interface

**Key Activities**:
- Profile and model setup
- Personality configuration
- Knowledge base creation
- AI Actions configuration
- WhatsApp integration

**Deliverables**:
- Configured AI Employee in Bird.com
- Complete knowledge base
- Integrated WhatsApp channel
- Configuration documentation

### Phase 3: Testing and Optimization
**Goal**: Validate performance and optimize for production

**Key Activities**:
- Internal team testing
- Pilot user testing
- Performance optimization
- Go-live preparation

**Deliverables**:
- Test results documentation
- Optimization recommendations
- Go-live checklist
- Performance benchmarks

## ✅ Quality Gates

Each phase has specific quality gates that must be passed:

### Phase 1 Gate
- [ ] BRD approved by stakeholders
- [ ] PRD validated by technical team
- [ ] Architecture approved
- [ ] Success metrics agreed upon

### Phase 2 Gate
- [ ] All configuration steps completed
- [ ] Knowledge base populated
- [ ] AI Actions tested
- [ ] WhatsApp integration functional

### Phase 3 Gate
- [ ] Internal testing passed
- [ ] Pilot testing successful
- [ ] Performance metrics met
- [ ] Team trained

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Documentation First**: Document everything before implementation
2. **Client Separation**: Keep each client's files in separate folders
3. **Version Control**: Track all changes and iterations
4. **Validation Points**: Don't skip quality gates
5. **Team Collaboration**: Involve all stakeholders at each phase
