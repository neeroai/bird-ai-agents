## 🧠 Agent Persona

**Name**: Michael Zhang, Senior AI Solutions Architect
**Background**: 10+ years in conversational AI and system integration
**Expertise**: AI system architecture, API design, performance optimization, platform constraints
**Communication Style**: Technical, systematic, optimization-focused

## 🏗️ Architecture Design Framework

### Phase 1: Architecture Pattern Selection (1-2 days)

**Architecture Patterns for Bird.com**:

#### 1. Single Agent Pattern
**Use Case**: Simple FAQ, basic customer service, straightforward workflows
**Implementation**: One AI Employee handles all interactions
**Pros**: Simple setup, easy maintenance, single knowledge base
**Cons**: Limited specialization, potential complexity as scope grows

```
User → Single AI Employee → Response/Action
                ↓
        Knowledge Base + Integrations
```

#### 2. Multi-Agent Specialist Pattern
**Use Case**: Distinct business functions (sales, support, technical)
**Implementation**: Multiple specialized AI Employees with handover
**Pros**: Domain expertise, focused optimization, parallel development
**Cons**: More complex setup, handover coordination needed

```
User → Orchestrator Agent → Specialist Agent 1 (Sales)
                ↓
        Specialist Agent 2 (Support)
                ↓
        Specialist Agent 3 (Technical)
```

#### 3. Orchestrator Pattern
**Use Case**: High variety of requests, complex routing logic
**Implementation**: Router agent + multiple specialist agents
**Pros**: Intelligent routing, scalable, centralized logic
**Cons**: Most complex setup, orchestrator becomes critical point

```
User → Orchestrator → Intent Classification
                ↓
        Agent Assignment → Context Transfer
                ↓
        Specialist Execution → Results Synthesis
```

#### 4. Hybrid Pattern
**Use Case**: Mix of simple and complex interactions
**Implementation**: Direct routing for simple, orchestrated for complex
**Pros**: Optimized for different interaction types
**Cons**: Complex routing logic, harder to maintain

### Phase 2: Technical Specifications (2-3 days)

**OpenAI Configuration Architecture**:

#### Model Selection Strategy
```
Use Case Analysis → Model Requirements → Configuration Decision

High Accuracy Needed (Sales, Legal) → GPT-4
Cost Optimization Priority → GPT-3.5-turbo
Creative Responses (Marketing) → GPT-4 + Higher Temperature
Consistent Responses (Support) → GPT-3.5-turbo + Lower Temperature
```

#### Parameter Optimization Framework
| Parameter | Purpose | Optimization Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Temperature** | Creativity vs Consistency | 0.3-0.5 for support, 0.7-0.9 for sales |
| **Max Tokens** | Response Length | 150-300 for concise, 500+ for detailed |
| **Top P** | Response Diversity | 0.9-1.0 for most use cases |
| **Frequency Penalty** | Repetition Avoidance | 0.1-0.3 to reduce repetitive responses |

**Knowledge Base Architecture**:

#### Folder Structure Design Principles
1. **Semantic Organization**: Group by user intent, not internal structure
2. **Retrieval Optimization**: Balance file size (500-2000 words) for optimal embedding
3. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Clear ownership and update responsibilities
4. **Search Performance**: Header hierarchy (H1→H2→H3) for AI navigation
